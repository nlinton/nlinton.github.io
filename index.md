Welcome.

I am a PhD student at Hokkaido University studying infectious disease modeling and mathematical epidemiology. I am currently located at Kyoto University.

My PhD focus is on the estimation and application of epidemiological parameters of COVID-19.

Before starting my PhD, I worked at local and state health departments in the United States, first in public health (chronic disease and maternal and child health) before moving into infectious disease surveillance.

This website serves as an online repository for my professional work.
